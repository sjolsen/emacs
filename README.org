* Configuration for GNU Emacs

This repository is organized to be separate from =~/.emacs.d=. All that's needed is to load the prelude file from =.emacs=. This can be done with ~(load-file "path/to/emacs/prelude.el")~ or by making =.emacs= a copy or symlink of the provided =init.el=.

Note that as a security feature, Emacs prompts you for permission to load untrusted themes, including previously trusted themes that have been modified. The easiest way to deal with this is to disable it entirely by setting ~custom-safe-themes~ to ~t~. I have not done this in =prelude.el= since it is, after all, a security feature.
