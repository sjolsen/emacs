* Configuration for GNU Emacs

For best results, symlink \~/.emacs.d to point to emacs2/.emacs.d, and put ~(load-file "path/to/emacs2/skel.el")~ in your .emacs. Point your Custom theme directory to .emacs.d/themes (~M-x customize-variable <RET> custom-theme-directory <RET>~) and enable or disable components of this customization set with ~M-x customize-themes~.

Note that as a security feature, Emacs prompts you for permission to load untrusted themes, including previously trusted themes that have been modified. So, if you're using my emacs-or-client.sh wrapper to automate Emacs daemonization, you'll run into trouble if I update a theme you have enabled (namely, the client window will never appear). To avoid this, make sure you run Emacs directly after any updates.

Oh, and some of the stuff in here doesn't jive with trunk Emacs, so if you're running that, proceed with caution.
